# Player-Impact-across-2023-24-EFL-Championship
Recently, I created an interactive Tableau dashboard analysing attacking and defensive impact across the 2023/24 EFL Championship. 

I wanted to explore how impact metrics (xG, tackles, interceptions, etc.) align with actual league outcomes, as well as which players stand out in attack and defence. 

As expected, radar charts tend to get messy when comparing more than 3 players! 

One key takeaway: filtering for games played can be crucial.

•	Jonathon Rowe stands out as an U21 performer…

•	…however, Crysencio Summerville and Jay Stansfield show strong attacking impact with more games played. 

This project brings together:

•	Team and player impact scores

•	Analysis of up-and-coming forwards (U21s)

•	Attacking and defensive radar chart comparisons 

•	Data-driven insights linked to real football performance 

Interesting to see that Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall ranks highest for attacking impact but doesn’t feature in the top 10 goal scorers before adjusting games played – proving you don’t always have to score goals to make an impact!
